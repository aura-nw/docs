In order to start building a smart contract you need to first properly setup your computer.

Aura uses [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/), a WebAssembly smart contract platform (or module) that integrate natively with [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk). Smart contracts are written in [RUST](https://www.rust-lang.org/), compiled into Wasm then uploaded to the Aura chain.

You can learn more about CosmWasm in the official [Cosmwasm document](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/docs/1.0/).

## Prerequisites

To develop any smart contract you will need to you will to install Node.js. If you further want to use Rust as your main language, then you need to install `rustup` as well.

#### Node.js
Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). We further recommend to install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com): 
```
npm install -g yarn
```

#### Rust and Wasm

Make sure you have all required binaries for programming with `Rust` and `Wasm`. The standard approach is to use `rustup` to maintain dependencies and handle updating multiple versions of `cargo`(v1.55.0+) and `rustc`. Follow [these instructions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) for setting up Rust.
```bash
# Get Rust in linux and MacOS
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```
After install `rustup` tool, make sure you add the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` toolchain which enables compiling Rust to [Web Assembly (wasm)](https://webassembly.org/).
```bash
# Check the target toolchains of rustup
rustup target list --installed
# Add the wasm toolchain
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```
#### Cargo

You must install cargo-generate and cargo-run-script by following commands:
```bash
cargo install cargo-generate --features vendored-openssl
cargo install cargo-run-script
```

#### Command-line tools
We will be using a few command-line tools extensively:
```bash
apt install jq curl
```

## Creating a new contract from template
Now, create your new contract. Go to the folder in which you want to place it and run:
```bash
cargo generate --git https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-template.git --name PROJECT_NAME
```
You will now have a new folder called `PROJECT_NAME` (I hope you changed that to something else) containing a simple working contract and build system that you can customize.

### Add a git Remote
After generating, you have a initialized local git repo, but no commits, and no remote. Go to a server (eg. github) and create a new upstream repo (called `YOUR-GIT-URL` below). Then run the following:

```bash
# this is needed to create a valid Cargo.lock file
cargo check
git branch -M main
git add .
git commit -m 'Initial Commit'
git remote add origin YOUR-GIT-URL
git push -u origin main
```
