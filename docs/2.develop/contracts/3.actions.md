Smart contracts can perform specific `Actions` such as transferring NEAR, or calling other contracts.

An important property of `Actions` is that they can be batched together when acting on the same contract. **Batched actions** act as a unit: they execute in the same [receipt](../../1.concepts/basics/transactions/overview.md#receipt-receipt), and if **any fails**, then they **all get reverted**.

## Transfer NEAR Ⓝ

You can send $NEAR from the your contract to any other account on the network. The Gas cost for transferring $NEAR is fixed and is based on the protocol's genesis config. Currently, it costs `~0.45 TGas`.


## Function Call

Your smart contract can call methods in another contract. In the snippet bellow we call a method in a deployed [Hello NEAR](../quickstart.md) contract, and check if everything went right in the callback.

## Create a Sub Account
Your contract can create direct sub accounts of itself, for example, `user.near` can create `sub.user.near`.

Accounts do **NOT** have control over their sub-accounts, since they have their own keys. 

Sub-accounts are simply useful for organizing your accounts (e.g. `dao.project.near`, `token.project.near`). -->
