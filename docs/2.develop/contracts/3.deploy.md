#sidebar_label: ♟️ Deploy a Contract

In order to deploy a contract on AURA network, make sure that you have done following requirements:
- [Install requirements](1.introduction.md).
- Build or download the Aura Daemon (`Aurad`), the official client for Aura Network, from [github](https://github.com/aura-nw/aura).
- Own a wallet by [creating AURA wallet](../1.wallet-creating.md).


## Setting up Environment
You need an environment to run contracts. You can either run your node locally or connect to an existing network. For easy testing, the `Euphoria` and `Serenity` testnet is live. You can use the testnets to deploy and run your contract.

The information of RPC Testnet can be retrieved at [here](../RPC/0.rpc.md).

To verify that the testnet is currently active, make sure the following URLs are working for you:
- https://rpc.euphoria.aura.network
- https://rpc.serenity.aura.network

The testnets have two native tokens set up - `aura` for Serenity testnet and `eaura` for Euphoria testnet.

Available Block Explorers:
- Euphoria Block Explorer: https://euphoria.aurascan.io/
- Serenity Block Explorer: https://serenity.aurascan.io/

You can use the block explorer to explore transactions, addresses, validators and contracts.

### Setting up aurad CLI

Let's configure the `aurad` executable, point it to the testnet, create a wallet and ask for tokens from faucet:

First source the network configuration for the Serenity testnet in the shell:

```bash
export RPC='https://rpc.serenity.aura.network'
export CHAIN_ID='serenity-testnet-001'
export NODE="--node \"$RPC\""
export TXFLAG="${NODE} --chain-id \"${CHAIN_ID}\" --gas-prices 0.025uaura --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3"
```

Set up wallet addresses:

```bash
aurad keys add wallet
```

Running the command above will add two encrypted private keys to the wasmd keyring and display their attributes as follows:
```
- name: wallet
  type: local
  address: aura1rh2hwghpazmw4vwr57u38ahk7a2xhjc6z9h7kt
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"AwnTb8Az+JddriHmcXx5VDY0RpcUAzMf/gCRVjWUB9HM"}'
  mnemonic: ""


**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

easy news coast scare already verb tongue throw mushroom strong scare seek magic useless maid erupt office stick sound noble machine weekend teach action
```

You must save the `mnemonic` for identification on the dapp later!

### Ask for token

To deploy and execute contract, you need to have some AURA token on tesnet.
Please follow the guide to ask for tokens at [serenity-testnet discord channel](https://github.com/aura-nw/testnets/tree/main/serenity-testnet-001).

### Deploy contract
Moving to the contract directory and compile the wasm contract with stable toolchain:
```bash
# compile the wasm contract with stable toolchain
rustup default stable
RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s' cargo wasm
```

Deploy contract:

```bash
# store contract
RES=$(aurad tx wasm store  ../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cw721_base.wasm --from wallet $TXFLAG --output json)
# get the code id
CODE_ID=$(echo $RES | jq -r '.logs[0].events[-1].attributes[0].value')
```

In case the CLI store doesn't return fully `tx_result`, but only returns results with `txhash`, we will have to get the `code_id` by querying from RPC:

```bash
CODE_ID=$(curl "https://rpc.serenity.aura.network/tx?hash=0x{txhash}"| jq -r ".result.tx_result.log"|jq -r ".[0].events[-1].attributes[0].value")
```

Please replace the txhash above with the txhash returned in the RES.

```bash
# set variable
INIT='{"minter":"{minter_address}","name":"Aura NFT","symbol":"ANFT"}'
```

In {minter_address} above is the address value of the minter obtained when creating the wallet, in that case value will be `aura1rh2hwghpazmw4vwr57u38ahk7a2xhjc6z9h7kt`

```bash
# instantiate contract
aurad tx wasm instantiate $CODE_ID "$INIT" --from wallet --label "cw721" $TXFLAG -y --no-admin
```
