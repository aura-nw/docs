Once your contract is deployed it is highly likely that you will want to interact with it from a web frontend.

## Connecting to a Contract
The first step on using a smart contract from a web-frontend is connecting to it. Connecting to the smart contract is actually composed by 3 simple steps:

1. Connecting to the AURA network (`testnet` or `mainnet`)
2. Initializing a Wallet, representing the user's wallet
3. Initializing a Contract, representing the contract itself
