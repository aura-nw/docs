## Aura Wallets
Your wallet is the entrance to the crypto world, then before getting into Aura Network, you should own a wallet. Aura Network is built using [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk) and the address of an Aura wallet follows the [standard address of Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/docs/1.0/architecture/addresses/) with defined prefix is `aura`.

```

```

## 1. Wallet Setup
If you are a *Cosmonaut*, you might directly skip to the next part. However, if you have not use a Cosmos wallet before, this is be the part you should follow closely.

### GUI Wallet
Aura Network currently supports 2 wallets: [Coin98 Wallet](https://wallet.coin98.com/) and [Keplr Wallet](https://www.keplr.app/). We recommend to use [Coin98 Wallet](https://wallet.coin98.com/) as we are working very closely together to roll out Aura specific features.

Please follow these guides from these 2 providers to setup your wallet:
- Coin98 guide: https://blog.coin98.com/c98-wallet-integrates-with-cosmos
- Keplr guide: https://medium.com/chainapsis/how-to-use-keplr-wallet-40afc80907f6

### Aura CLI
You can easily setup and manage your aura wallets in the `aurad` CLI. You can add a new wallet by running the following command:

```bash
aurad keys add <key-name>
```

Running the command above will add two encrypted private keys to the wasmd keyring and display their attributes as follows:

```
- name: wallet
  type: local
  address: aura1rh2hwghpazmw4vwr57u38ahk7a2xhjc6z9h7kt
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"AwnTb8Az+JddriHmcXx5VDY0RpcUAzMf/gCRVjWUB9HM"}'
  mnemonic: ""


**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

easy news coast scare already verb tongue throw mushroom strong scare seek magic useless maid erupt office stick sound noble machine weekend teach action
```

:::caution
As the warning message in the CLI says, you should write down your mnemonic phrase in a safe place as it is the only way to recover your account.
:::

You can view your wallet address with this command:

```bash
aurad keys show <key-name> -a
```

Or you can view all of them by running:

```bash
aurad keys list
```

:::info Note
Make sure you're on the right network. Check your config with: `aurad config`.
:::

The remaining portion of this section covers the setup for GUI wallets, so you can skip that if you're not interested.

## 2. Add Testnet Profile
In order to show the Aura address on your wallet, you have to add the network information to [Coin98 Wallet](https://wallet.coin98.com/) and [Keplr Wallet](https://www.keplr.app/).

At the moment, there are 2 public testnet options to work with Aura Network. Depending on your interest, please choose the appropriate testnet before adding them to your wallet. As Aura Network is still in development, the aura client is subjected to change frequently. 

To ensure the best experience of testnet users, there are 2 independent testnets at the moment: **Euphoria** (`aura_6321-3`) and **Serenity** (`auradev_1236-2`).

### **Euphoria**, the staging testnet:
Target users: `Validator`, `App Developer`, `First-Timer` and the majority of `Aura users`.

**Euphoria** similar to the staging environment concept in traditional software development, **Euphoria** is the near exact replica of **Aura Mainnet**. This means we will try our best to bootstrap external validators, set up vesting, voting and operate the **Euphoria** bootstrap community as closely as we will do on **Aura Mainnet** in the future.

Use this following [Script](https://jsfiddle.net/eledra/rmh95s3x/) to add the **Aura Euphoria Testnet** chain to your wallet browser extension:

:::tip
We recommend you use the jsfiddle links to quickly add the testnet profiles to your wallets.
:::

```js
var foo = async function() {
  console.log('start request add euphoria testnet');

  await window['keplr'].experimentalSuggestChain({
    chainId: "aura_6321-3",
    chainName: "Aura euphoria TestNet",
    rpc: "https://rpc.euphoria.aura.network",
    rest: "https://lcd.euphoria.aura.network",
    bip44: {
      coinType: 118,
    },
    bech32Config: {
      bech32PrefixAccAddr: "aura",
      bech32PrefixAccPub: "aura" + "pub",
      bech32PrefixValAddr: "aura" + "valoper",
      bech32PrefixValPub: "aura" + "valoperpub",
      bech32PrefixConsAddr: "aura" + "valcons",
      bech32PrefixConsPub: "aura" + "valconspub",
    },
    currencies: [{
      coinDenom: "EAURA",
      coinMinimalDenom: "ueaura",
      coinDecimals: 6,
      // coinGeckoId: "eaura",
    }, ],
    feeCurrencies: [{
      coinDenom: "EAURA",
      coinMinimalDenom: "ueaura",
      coinDecimals: 6,
      // coinGeckoId: "ueaura",
    }, ],
    stakeCurrency: {
      coinDenom: "EAURA",
      coinMinimalDenom: "ueaura",
      coinDecimals: 6,
      // coinGeckoId: "ueaura",
    },
    coinType: 118,
    gasPriceStep: {
      low: 0.001,
      average: 0.0025,
      high: 0.004
    },
    features: ['no-legacy-stdTx'],
    walletUrlForStaking: "https://euphoria.aurascan.io/validators",
    logo: "https://i.imgur.com/zi0mTYb.png",
    explorer: "https://euphoria.aurascan.io/"
  });
  console.log('finish request add euphoria testnet');
};

setTimeout(() => {
  foo()
  console.log(window.keplr)
}, 1001);

console.log('Welcome to euphoria');
```
After running the script, the Aura Testnet profile will appear in the Coin98 Wallet extension

### **Serenity**, the stable testnet:
Target users: `App Developer`.

**Serenity** testnet is determined to be fairly stable with a minimum validator set. Users who want to get the first hand experience in Aura should try with this network. **Serenity** is publicly open to dApp builders through public RPC endpoints. However, it is not open for external validators.

Use this following [Script](https://jsfiddle.net/eledra/kc6yhLpz/) to add the `Aura Serenity Testnet` chain to your wallet browser extension:
```js
var foo = async function() {
  console.log('start request add Serenity testnet');

  await window['keplr'].experimentalSuggestChain({
    chainId: "auradev_1236-2",
    chainName: "Aura Serenity TestNet",
    rpc: "https://rpc.serenity.aura.network",
    rest: "https://lcd.serenity.aura.network",
    bip44: {
      coinType: 118,
    },
    bech32Config: {
      bech32PrefixAccAddr: "aura",
      bech32PrefixAccPub: "aura" + "pub",
      bech32PrefixValAddr: "aura" + "valoper",
      bech32PrefixValPub: "aura" + "valoperpub",
      bech32PrefixConsAddr: "aura" + "valcons",
      bech32PrefixConsPub: "aura" + "valconspub",
    },
    currencies: [{
      coinDenom: "AURA",
      coinMinimalDenom: "uaura",
      coinDecimals: 6,
      // coinGeckoId: "aura",
    }, ],
    feeCurrencies: [{
      coinDenom: "AURA",
      coinMinimalDenom: "uaura",
      coinDecimals: 6,
      // coinGeckoId: "uaura",
    }, ],
    stakeCurrency: {
      coinDenom: "AURA",
      coinMinimalDenom: "uaura",
      coinDecimals: 6,
      // coinGeckoId: "uaura",
    },
    coinType: 118,
    gasPriceStep: {
      low: 0.001,
      average: 0.0025,
      high: 0.004
    },
    features: ['no-legacy-stdTx'],
    walletUrlForStaking: "https://serenity.aurascan.io/validators",
    logo: "https://i.imgur.com/zi0mTYb.png",
    explorer: "https://serenity.aurascan.io/"
  });
  console.log('finish request add Serenity testnet');
};

setTimeout(() => {
  foo()
  console.log(window.keplr)
}, 1001);

console.log('Welcome to Serenity');
```
## 3. Create Aura Wallet
The final step is to create a new Aura Wallet. Just click the **Add Wallet** button on the top right corner of the browser extension. After creating your Aura Wallet, you will be ready to try the testnet.

If you need some test **AURA** or **EAURA** you can get some through our [Discord Faucets](env-setup#faucets). After that, you can head on to try some of our apps, like [HaloTrade](https://docs.halotrade.zone/).

Happy Hacking!
