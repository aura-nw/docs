:::info before starting
In order to deploy a contract on AURA network, make sure that you have properly set up your [development environment](../getting-started/env-setup), created and setup your [Aura wallet](../getting-started/wallet-creation), and have some [test AURA or EAURA](../getting-started/env-setup#faucets).

## Aura CLI Config
In this section we will be working on `euphoria-2` staging testnet, but you may choose to use any network. Of course we recommend you use testnets only. 

First let's make sure you have properly setup your `aurad` CLI. You can verify by running `aurad config` and it should look something like this if you're also using `euphoria-2`:

```bash
$ aurad config
{
	"chain-id": "euphoria-2",
	"keyring-backend": "test",
	"output": "text",
	"node": "https://rpc.euphoria.aura.network:443",
	"broadcast-mode": "sync"
}
```

In case it doesn't, you can either `export` it straight from the shell or by going to the directory and manually changing the values depending on the chain you'll be using, which should be located in `~/.aura/config/client.toml`. You can find the reference configuration for all chains [here](../getting-started/env-setup#using-aura-cli-with-a-public-node).

The block explorers are available for all Aura networks. You can explore transactions, addresses, tokens of any kind, contracts, validators, etc. 

* Mainnet: https://aurascan.io
* Euphoria: https://euphoria.aurascan.io
* Serenity: https://serenity.aurascan.io

And if you need the full reference, check out the [networks info](../getting-started/networks-info). 

Once that is all done and you have your [wallet](../getting-started/wallet-creation#aura-cli) ready with some [test coins](../getting-started/env-setup#faucets) (*AURA* or *EAURA*), you can continue.

## Build

First let's clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aura-nw/flower-store-contract
```

To build the contract which just builds to confirm everything is correct, you can run:

```bash
cargo build
```

For this example the contract should build without any issues, but in other instances you may need some help debugging errors and warnings. Normally the Rust compiler does a great job on pointing out what's wrong, but another alternative which includes a linter is using:

```bash
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

Now let's compile the code. There are a few approaches you can take on this, and you should choose the one that meets your needs accordingly. On this example we wil use the `Optimized compilation`.

* Basic compilation:
```bash
cargo wasm
```
* Optimized compilation:
```bash
RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s' cargo wasm
```
* Reproducible and optimized compilation:
```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/code/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/rust-optimizer:0.13
```

Another recommendation is to write and use tests properly to ensure everything works as expected. In the flower example we included a set of tests for the contract, you can run it with `cargo test` which should return this, showing that in fact, all tests have passed.

```bash
cargo test

...

running 5 tests
test contract::tests::not_works_with_query ... ok
test contract::tests::not_works_with_add_new_id_existed ... ok
test contract::tests::not_works_with_sell ... ok
test contract::tests::initialization ... ok
test contract::tests::works_with_add_new_and_sell ... ok

test result: ok. 5 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

```

Once that is done, we can move on and deploy our contract.

## Deploy
We can compile the wasm contract with the stable toolchain before deploying it like so:
```bash
rustup default stable
RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s' cargo wasm
```

Now, let's go ahead and deploy the contract. When we want to deploy a contract to Aura Network, we must do so in two steps:

### 1. Store the code
We execute a `store` transaction type with the compiled code of the contract, and this stores it in the blockchain with a specific `CODE ID`.

```bash
# store contract
RES=$(aurad tx wasm store  ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/flower_store.wasm --from wallet --output json --fees 25000ueaura --gas 2000000)
# get the code id
CODE_ID=$(echo $RES | jq -r '.logs[0].events[-1].attributes[0].value')
```

In case the CLI store doesn't return the full `tx_result`, but only returns results with `txhash`, we will have to get the `code_id` by querying from RPC:

```bash
# get the code id
CODE_ID=$(curl "https://rpc.euphoria.aura.network/tx?hash=0x{TX_HASH}"| jq -r ".result.tx_result.log"|jq -r ".[0].events[-1].attributes[0].value")
```

Or you can also check the transaction on **Aurascan** where the **Code Id** will be displayed as well. You can get the transaction hash by running `$RES`, and it should look like this on Aurascan.

<div id="img-wrapper">
    <img src="/img/aurascan/aurascan-code-id.png" alt="aurascan-code-id"/>
</div>

In this case, the `CODE ID` is **1186**, we will use it in the next step.

### 2. Instantiate a contract with the stored code
In this step, we will execute an `instantiate` transaction in which we will specify the initialization arguments the contract takes and the `CODE ID` of the stored contract from the previous step.

```bash
# set initialization arguments
INIT='{"name":"init-flower","amount":1,"price":1}'
# instantiate contract
aurad tx wasm instantiate $CODE_ID $INIT --from wallet --label "flower-contract" --gas 2000000 --fees 25000ueaura --no-admin
```

Now our contract is stored and instantiated on the blockchain! We can now see the contract instantiated in [Aurascan](../../product/aurascan/) which should look like on the picture below. 

<div id="img-wrapper">
    <img src="/img/aurascan/aurascan-instantiated-contract.png" alt="aurascan-code-id"/>
</div>


On the last part of this section we will continue working with the same contract we just deployed. We will be interacting with it with the `aurad` CLI.
