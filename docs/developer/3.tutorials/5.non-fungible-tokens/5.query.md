We now know how to change the state of the contract, but what if we just want to read its details? We don't need to pay transaction fees on that, do we? No, my friend. That is what querying is for!

Querying is the other half of the coin to messages. You can think of queries as a database read, or a way of querying the state.

So as we did with all other sections let's head to where it starts: `src/msg.rs`.

## QueryMsg and Query Response

```rust title=src/msg.rs
pub enum QueryMsg {
    GetConfig {},
}

pub struct ConfigResponse {
    pub owner: Addr,
    pub cw20_address: Addr,
    pub cw721_address: Option<Addr>,
    pub max_tokens: u32,
    pub unit_price: Uint128,
    pub name: String,
    pub symbol: String,
    pub token_uri: String,
    pub extension: Extension,
    pub unused_token_id: u32,
}
```

Our `QueryMsg` is very simple. Because we only define a single state - the `Config` struct, so we only need a single `QueryMsg` to get the `Config`.

Below `QueryMsg`, we define the `ConfigResponse` struct to be used as the return value for the `GetConfig {}` query. Its fields are the same as the `Config` struct state.

## Query Logic

```rust title=src/contract.rs
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn query(deps: Deps, _env: Env, msg: QueryMsg) -> StdResult<Binary> {
    match msg {
        QueryMsg::GetConfig {} => to_binary(&query_config(deps)?),
    }
}

fn query_config(deps: Deps) -> StdResult<ConfigResponse> {
    let config = CONFIG.load(deps.storage)?;
    Ok(ConfigResponse {
        owner: config.owner,
        cw20_address: config.cw20_address,
        cw721_address: config.cw721_address,
        max_tokens: config.max_tokens,
        unit_price: config.unit_price,
        name: config.name,
        symbol: config.symbol,
        token_uri: config.token_uri,
        extension: config.extension,
        unused_token_id: config.unused_token_id,
    })
}
```

You can see in that in the `query` function, `QueryMsg` are handled differently than `InstantiateMsg` or `ExecuteMsg`. When returning from a query you don't return via a `Response`. You must define a custom struct which can then be encoded into `Binary`.

When `msg` matches with `QueryMsg::GetConfig{}`, the query thread is passed to the `query_config` function.

In the `query_config` method, by using `load()`, we get the `CONFIG` Item data previously stored in the store and assign it to a `config` variable. 

And at the end, it's a simple return line using the Ok structure, inside it is a `ConfigResponse` struct containing the return result.

In the next chapter we will test what we have written from the `Instantiate` to `Query` chapter. For now, we're done!
