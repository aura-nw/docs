# What is contract?
Smart contracts are simple programs that live in a AURA network. As any modern application, smart contracts store data and expose methods to interact with them.

They are written in human-readable languages, then compiled and deployed to an account where everyone can interact with them.

Do not worry if you don't know how smart-contract blockchains work. As a developer, it is sufficient to understand that AURA smart-contracts:
1. Have **limited** computational resources.
2. Interact with other contracts in an **asynchronous** way.
3. Deal with **real money**, for which security must be a top concern.

## Programming Languages
Developers can use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) with [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/), a WebAssembly smart contract platform (or module) that integrate natively with Cosmos SDK to write smart contracts in AURA.

While it is not necessary to be an expert in `Rust` and `CosmWasm`, during these docs we will assume you have a basic knowledge about them.
