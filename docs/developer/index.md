Hello there! Welcome to our documentation. Here you will learn everything about developing decentralized applications (dApp) in AURA. If you are new to smart contracts, do not worry. We will get you up to speed and you will be developing your own dApp in no time.

## Overview
AURA network is a smart contract chain that uses proof-of-stake (PoS) to achieve distributed consensus
among validators and confirm all transactions executed within. Like most blockchains, AURA is completely
transparent. Additionally, aura is a [permissioned](https://github.com/orgs/aura-nw/discussions/1) smart
contract blockchain which ensures no malicious contracts can be deployed on mainnet where real value is 
at stake.

AURA uses smart contracts to create decentralized applications. Deploying a one requires paying a gas fee
in AURA for the compiled code to be stored in the blockchain forever as well as for instantiation. 
**Once instantiated, the contract is immutable, so make sure your code is safe!**

## Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are simple programs that runs on the AURA Network. As any modern application, smart contracts store data and expose methods to interact with them.

They are written in human-readable languages, compiled and finally deployed to an account where everyone can interact with them and view all previously executed transactions. 

Anyone can write their own code and deploy onto AURA testnets freely or submit a request for mainnet deployment. They have many applications such as creating digital assets, marketplaces, games, etc. 

## First steps
Get started by [setting up your wallet](getting-started/wallet-creation) or if you 
already have your wallet setup, skip ahead to [setting up your development environment](getting-started/env-setup). 
Otherwise, check out these topics and happy hacking!
