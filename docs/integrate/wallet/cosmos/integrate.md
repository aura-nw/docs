# Wallet Integration

Aura Network currently supports 2 wallets: [Coin98 Wallet](https://wallet.coin98.com/) and [Keplr Wallet](https://www.keplr.app/). We recommend to use [Coin98 Wallet](https://wallet.coin98.com/) as we are working very closely together to roll out Aura specific features.

Please follow guides from these 2 providers to setup your wallet (**only the Web Browser Extension version at the moment**)

# Native $Aura integration

Aura mainnet is developed using [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk). So if you support popular coins like [ATOM](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cosmos-hub), the process is very similar.

Depending on the network (dev, testnet or mainnet), wallet integration needs to put in different configuration. Here is a list of references for each network we are running currently.

| Network  | Description             | Wallet Configuration                  |
|----------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Xstaxy   | Mainnet                 | https://github.com/aura-nw/mainnet-artifacts/tree/main/wallet-integration |
| Euphoria | Public stable Testnet   | https://jsfiddle.net/eledra/rmh95s3x/ |
| Serenity | Public unstable Testnet | https://jsfiddle.net/eledra/kc6yhLpz/ |
