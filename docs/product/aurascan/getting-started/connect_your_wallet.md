Before performing any interactions like staking or voting on proposals with Aurascan, you will have to connect your personal wallet to the interface. 

## On Desktop browser
All users must have a personal wallet connected. For now, Aurascan supports Coin98 and Keplr wallet. Please click the `Connect wallet` button at the left side below the menu header bar of the screen.
